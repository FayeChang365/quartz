title: Welcome to my digital garden!
---
It's still very much a work-in-progress, but I'm planning to publish writing including
- creative non-fiction
- cultural analysis
- essay-ish pieces of writing (probably with improper citation)
- longer-form writing
- and anything else that might not be publish-able in a proper magazine, journal, or newspaper

Would love to hear any comments you have, but in order to write them on any given page, you're going to have to reload the page and sign in with GitHub for the comment box. Will hopefully be making it less of a hassle soon!
